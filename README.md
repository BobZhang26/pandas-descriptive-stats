# Descriptive Statistics Project

This project demonstrates the calculation of basic descriptive statistics (minimum, maximum, and mean) for a dataset pulled from an online source.

## Project Structure
- **mylib.py**: Contains functions to compute the min, max, and mean of the dataset.
- **main.py**: Implements the process of pulling the dataset, calling functions from `mylib.py`, and displaying results.
- **test_main.py**: Includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the statistical functions.

## How to Run
1. Install required dependencies.
2. Run `main.py` to see results.
3. Use `test_main.py` to run tests.
